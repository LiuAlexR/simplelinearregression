# simplelinearregression
This is a simple project to calculate and plot the line of best fit, of a given degree of polynomial. 

Inside the folder src/main/resources, there are many sample points.txt files. These are formatted with the number of points on the first line, and subsequent points on the following lines, where the x and y coordinates are separated by a comma. To plot a particular set, change the filepath in Main.java to the desired txt file
